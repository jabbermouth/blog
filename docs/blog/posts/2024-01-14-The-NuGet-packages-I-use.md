# The NuGet Packages I Use

This article is simply a list of the common NuGet packages I use. This list should be viewed as a “this is what I do” list rather than a recommendation. This isn’t an exhaustive list and will be updated over time. For example, a few months ago I switched from Moq to NSubstitute. Please note that some of the packages are mine.

- Serilog.AspNetCore
- Serilog.Enrichers.Environment
- Serilog.Enrichers.Thread
