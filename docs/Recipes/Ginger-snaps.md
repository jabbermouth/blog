# Ginger Snaps
 
## Ingredients

- 500 g butter, melted (plus extra for greasing)
- 4 US cups (400g) flour
- 2 US cups (450g) sugar
- 1 US cup (240ml) golden syrup
- 4 tbsp ground ginger
- 2 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 2 tsp baking powder (not needed if using self-raising flour)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 150C or gas mark 2.
2. Add the melted butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl and beat together till the mixture becomes soft and creamy in texture. Add the golden syrup and mix well.
3. Using a sieve, shift the flour, ground cinnamon and ginger into the mixture. This will make sure that the mixture remains smooth and not lumpy.
4. Once mixed, use a tablespoon to scoop up individual portions (no more than 2cm across) and roll into a loose ball. Gently press to flatten (but not completely) on a greased baking tray and place in the oven for 18 mins. Allow to cool before removing from the baking tray.

A typical tray will fit 9 biscuits and the batch produces approximately 60 biscuits.
