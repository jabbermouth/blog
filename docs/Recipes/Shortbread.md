- 340g Plain Flour
- 115g Caster Sugar
- 250g Butter (I use Sainsbury's Taste The Difference salted Jersey Butter)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 155-160°C (325°F) – Gas Mark 3.
2. Mix flour and sugar in a bowl, rub in butter.
3. Knead well to form a smooth paste.
4. Roll out (about 8mm/0.25″ thick) and cut into biscuits of desired size.  Alternatively, take little balls of mixture and flatten into rounded biscuits by hand.
5. Decorate top with a fork and place on a greased baking tray with 1 or 2 centimetres spacing between each biscuit.
6. Bake for 25 minutes in fan oven till pale and golden.
7. Once out of the oven, place on wire tray to cool

## Notes

I put two sheets in at once about 1/4 and 3/4 up the oven and swap about half way through (not sure if this is needed) however different ovens may require a different approach/cooking time.
