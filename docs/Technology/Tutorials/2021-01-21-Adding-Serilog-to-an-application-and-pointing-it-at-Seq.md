# Adding Serilog to an application and pointing it at Seq

Firstly, let's add all the NuGet packages we'll need:

- Serilog.AspNetCore
- Serilog.Enrichers.Environment
- Serilog.Enrichers.Process
- Serilog.Enrichers.Thread
- Serilog.Settings.Configuration
- Serilog.Sinks.Seq

Create a new file called serilog.json and populate it with the following, replacing the serverUrl and apiKey (or completely removing that element if not required).

```json
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Warning"
      }
    },
    "Enrich": [ "FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithProcessId", "WithThreadId" ],
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "Seq",
        "Args": {
          "serverUrl": "http://seq.yourdomain.com:5341",
          "apiKey": "YourApiKey"
        }
      },
      { "Name": "Console" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Next we'll modify Main in Program.cs. If all your Main methods contains is CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run(); then you can simply replace the contents with the following:

```csharp
var loggingConfiguration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddJsonFile("serilog.json")
    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
    .Build();

Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(loggingConfiguration)
    .CreateLogger();

try
{
    Log.Information("Application starting up");
    CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    Log.Fatal(ex, "Application start failed");
}
finally
{
    Log.CloseAndFlush();
}
```

Then, in the CreateHostBuilder method, after `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)` add the following:

```csharp
.UseSerilog()
```

Finally, if you want to log requests, in the Configure method of Startup.cs, before `app.UseRouting()`, add the following line:

```csharp
app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();
```

If you encounter any missing usings, use control+. and add them as needed.

Don't forget to inject and use an ILogger instance of your controllers to log errors, warnings, etcâ€¦

The last thing to do is remove the Logging section from appsettings.json.

If you want to override the API key with an environment variable, for example as part of a deployment process, you would use the following variable name:

```csharp
Serilog__WriteTo__0__Args__apiKey
```

If you want to exclude health checks from request logging, [Andrew Lock's blog](https://andrewlock.net/using-serilog-aspnetcore-in-asp-net-core-3-excluding-health-check-endpoints-from-serilog-request-logging/) has a great solution. I've packaged this in a NuGet package, `Serilog.Extras`, along with a couple of enrichers that I required. Note this package is targeting .NET 6.

Once you've referenced the above NuGet package, replace:

```csharp
app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();
```

With the following:

```csharp
app.UseSerilogRequestLoggingWithoutHealthChecks();
```

You'll also need to add a using for Serilog.Extras to enable this extension.

The two enrichers are `WithVersionNumber` and `WithDeploymentEnvironment` which add the values of the environment variables `VERSION_NUMBER` and `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` respectively to your output logs.
